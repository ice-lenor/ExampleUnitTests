## What to do with this
1. Open the tutorial.
2. Open `GeometryHelpersTest.java` and look at it while reading the tutorial.
3. Run the tests.
4. Think about what else you could test. I'm sure there is something I missed!
5. Apply the best practices in your own project.
6. Like the tutorial? Share, like, subscribe, say thanks. I'll be happy to know it!

## How to run tests
I run this with Intellij IDEA and Java 1.8+.
1. Download the source code.
2. Open the folder with the code in Intellij IDEA.
3. Open the file `GeometryHelpersTest.java`. You'll see green "Run test" buttons next to line numbers. Press the one next to `class GeometryHelpersTest` and watch the whole test suite execute.
