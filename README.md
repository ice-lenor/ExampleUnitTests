## What to do with this
1. Open the tutorial.
1. Open `GeometryHelpers.java`.
1. Open `GeometryHelpersTest1.java`. Review the test structure. Run the test.
1. Open `GeometryHelpersTest2.java`.
1. Compare the first test in `GeometryHelpersTest1.java` with the first test in `GeometryHelpersTest2.java`. See how even the smallest pieces of domain area knowledge are important?
1. Think about what else you could test. I'm sure there is something I missed!
1. Apply the best practices in your own project.

## How to run tests
I run this with Intellij IDEA and Java 1.8+.
1. Download the source code.
2. Open the folder with the code in Intellij IDEA.
3. Open the file `GeometryHelpersTest.java`. You'll see green "Run test" buttons next to line numbers. Press the one next to `class GeometryHelpersTest` and watch the whole test suite execute.
